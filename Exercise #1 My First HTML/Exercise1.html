    <h2><i>What do you think web design is about?</i></h2>
        <p>I think web design is about organizing data in a coded language. Web design is all about providing a visual and interactive</p>
        <p>experience for a user at no damage to our environment.</p>


    <h2><i>What are your thoughts on planet-centric design and your initial thoughts on the user experience of design?</i></h2>
        <p>There are 17 goals within the planet-cetric design, and although each one is quite motivating, I will give my</p>
    <p>opinion on two of the goals specifically; hunger and poverty.</p>
        <p>It is my opinion that global hunger and poverty are caused by corporate greed. Michael Green once said that,</p>
            
            <p>&quot;The pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can&#39;t get better are simply wrong.&quot;</p>

        <p>Although I do agree with Michael Green, I do believe that until morals and ethics are more important than greed</p>
    <p>and consumption, the world will never get better. The majority of humans these days are so out of touch with their</p>
    <p>personal connection of the mind,body and soul, that the collective shadow looms heavily over all life forms on this planet.</p>

        <p>The impressive actions that were taken in countries such as Norway, Costa Rico, and China could be a guideline for Parliment</p>
    <p>to balance the foundations of wellbeing by providing opportunity to improve citzens lives. It has been proven that if you</p>
    <p>invest the wealth of a country into the foundations of wellbeing of its citizens the score for said country on the Social Progress</p>
    <p>Index increases significantly.</p>
        <p>With the increased cost to food and housing in Canada, Parliment should invest the return in better ways to help its citizens.</p>
    <p>Instead, Canada ranks 10th in the top 15 countries on the Social Progress Index. In my opinion this is due to the rise of</p>
    <p>mental health issues that typically stem from the following issues:</p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Poverty - <i>i.e. housing crisis, lack of sustainable food sources, and low income</i></p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Personal safety - <i>i.e. increased crime rate</i></p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Failure to provide affordable education - <i>i.e. high post secondary tuition costs</i></p>
        <p><b>4.</b> Impeeding on personal rights - <i>i.e. freedom of choice without cohersion and divine rights to govern their body</i></p>
    
        <p>If Canada spent more time and resources in supporting its citizens with its most basic needs of health and wellness, I belive</p>
    <p>that our rating on the Social Progress Index would take a huge leap forward.</p>
    

    <h2><i>How important do you think web design and development is in today&#39;s digital world?</i></h2>
        <p>I belive that web deign is extremely important in today&#39;s digital world. What the intention of the web platform has, I believe</p>
    <p>that web design helps significantly with promoting affordable if not free education that will assist all to become better
    <p>versions of selves and collective living beings in general.</p>
